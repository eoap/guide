## Installing a CWL Runner
To run CWL workflows, you'll need to install a CWL runner. The most popular CWL runner is cwltool, which is a reference implementation of the CWL standard. cwltool can be installed using pip, the Python package installer.

Here's how to install cwltool:

1. Install Python: cwltool requires Python 3.5 or later. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install pip: pip is the package installer for Python. If you don't have pip installed, you can download it from the official website: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
3. Install cwltool: Once you have pip installed, you can install cwltool using the following command:

````
pip install cwltool
````
 4. Verify the installation: To verify that cwltool was installed correctly, you can run the following command:

````
cwltool --version
````

This should print the version number of cwltool.

## YAML Syntax
CWL documents are typically written in YAML, which is a human-readable data serialization language. YAML files consist of a series of key-value pairs, with indentation used to indicate the hierarchy of the data.

Here's an example of a simple YAML file:
````yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
occupation: Software Developer
````
In this example, name, age, and occupation are keys, and John Doe, 30, and Software Developer are values.

Here are some important YAML syntax rules to keep in mind:

 * YAML is case-sensitive
 * YAML uses indentation to indicate hierarchy
 * Indentation must be consistent throughout the file
 * Lists are indicated using a dash (-) followed by a space
 * Strings can be enclosed in single or double quotes

Here's an example of a YAML file that includes a list:

````yaml
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
````

In this example, fruits is a key, and apple, banana, and orange are values in a list.

Familiarizing yourself with YAML syntax is essential for working with CWL documents, as CWL workflows and tools are typically defined using YAML.
